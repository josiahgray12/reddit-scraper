# Nookly Reddit Monitor - Maintenance Guide

## Quick Start

### Daily Tasks
1. Check if the system is running:
   ```bash
   python check-status.py
   ```
   You should see:
   - ‚úÖ System Status: Running
   - ‚úÖ Configuration files present
   - ‚úÖ Log files created
   - üìù Number of threads monitored today
   - üìß Last email sent

2. Check your email for the daily digest (sent at 8 AM)

### Weekly Tasks
1. Check the logs for any errors:
   ```bash
   python view-logs.py
   ```
   Look for any red error messages or warnings.

2. Verify Reddit API usage:
   - Go to [Reddit's Developer Portal](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
   - Check if your app is still active
   - Verify the API usage limits

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. System Not Running
If `check-status.py` shows the system is not running:

1. Start the system:
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```

2. If it doesn't start, check the error message and:
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory: `/opt/reddit-monitor`
   - Verify Python is installed: `python --version`
   - Check if the virtual environment is active (you should see `(venv)` at the start of your command line)

### 2. No Daily Digest Emails
If you're not receiving the daily digest emails:

1. Check your spam folder
2. Verify email settings in `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "email": {
           "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
           "smtp_port": 587,
           "sender_email": "your-email@gmail.com",
           "sender_password": "your-app-password",
           "recipient_email": "your-email@gmail.com"
       }
   }
   ```
3. Make sure your Gmail App Password is still valid

### 3. Reddit API Issues
If you see Reddit API errors:

1. Check your Reddit API credentials in the `.env` file:
   ```
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   REDDIT_USER_AGENT=NooklyBot/1.0
   ```
2. Verify these credentials in the [Reddit Developer Portal](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
